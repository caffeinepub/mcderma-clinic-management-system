# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix critical backend errors preventing lead saving and admin password setup.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement or fix the backend addLead function to properly store lead data with all required fields
- Implement missing backend functions for admin password management (setAdminPassword, unlockAdmin)
- Ensure proper data persistence and error handling for both lead and admin operations

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully save new leads through the lead entry form, and admins can complete password setup without encountering backend errors.
