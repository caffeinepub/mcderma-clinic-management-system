# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the calendar visibility issue in the New Appointment dialog so the entire calendar is displayed properly.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust the calendar component's container height and layout in the New Appointment dialog to ensure all weeks of the month are fully visible
- Fix any overflow or clipping issues that are causing the calendar to be cut off at the bottom
- Ensure proper spacing and layout on mobile devices

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see and interact with the complete calendar when creating a new appointment, with all dates and navigation controls fully visible without needing to scroll or resize the dialog.
