  "summary": "The diff implements backend fixes for both lead storage (REQ-1) and admin password management (REQ-2). The backend main.mo shows Lead type definition with all required fields and Map-based storage structure. Frontend hooks show useAddLead and useUpdateLead mutations, and AdminGateDialog implements password setup and verification flows with proper hashing. However, the main.mo backend file is truncated at 4000 chars, preventing verification of complete addLead function implementation, admin password backend functions (getAdminConfig, setupAdminConfig, verifyAdminPassword), and their integration with the frontend mutations.",
